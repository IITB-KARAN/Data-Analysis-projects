# Beginner-level Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains beginner-level data analysis projects implemented in *Python (Jupyter Notebooks)*.  
The projects cover fundamental concepts in *statistics, data visualization, and machine learning*.

## Projects

1. *Titanic Survival Analysis (Chi-Square Test)*
   - Tested if survival was independent of gender and passenger class.
   - Tools: Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib.

2. *Customer Segmentation (K-Means Clustering)*
   - Segmented Mall Customers dataset using income and spending score.
   - Visualized clusters and centroids with Matplotlib.

3. *Height-Weight Dataset Analysis*
   - Performed descriptive statistics and hypothesis testing.
   - Conducted Z-tests and T-tests on sample populations.

4. *Central Limit Theorem Simulation*
   - Simulated random sampling to demonstrate CLT.
   - Compared theoretical vs empirical means and standard deviations.

## Tools Used
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy, Pandas, SciPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
